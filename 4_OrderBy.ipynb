    "# Order By\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll learn how to change the order of your results using the **ORDER BY** clause, and you'll explore a popular use case by applying ordering to dates. To illulstrate what you'll learn in this tutorial, we'll work with a slighly modified version of our familiar `pets` table.\n",

    "\n",
    "## ORDER BY\n",
    "\n",
    "**ORDER BY** is usually the last clause in your query, and it sorts the results returned by the rest of your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the rows are not ordered by the `ID` column. We can quickly remedy this with the query below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT ID, Name, Animal\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery.public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    ORDER BY ID\n",
    "    \n",
    "The **ORDER BY** clause also works for columns containing text, where the results show up in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT ID, Name, Animal\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery.public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    ORDER BY Animal\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can reverse the order using the **DESC** argument (short for 'descending'). The next query sorts the table by the `Animal` column, where the values that are last in alphabetical order are returned fist.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT ID, Name, Animal\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery.public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    ORDER BY Animal DESC\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Dates\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll talk about dates, becase they come up very frequently in real-world databases. There are two ways that dates can be stored in BigQuery: as DATE or as DATETIME.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DATE** format has the year first, then the month and then the day. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    YYYY-[M]M-[D]D\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - YYYY: Four-digit year\n",
    "    - [M]M: One or two digit month\n",
    "    - [D]D: One or two digit day\n",
    "    \n",
    "So `2019-01-10` is interpreted as January 10, 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DATETIME** format is like the date format... but with time added at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## EXTRACT\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you'll want to look at part of a date, like the year or the day. You can do this with **EXTRACT**. We'll illustrate this with a slighly different table, called `pets_with_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](petsdate.PNG \"pets\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The query below returns two columns, where column `Day` contains the day corresponding to each entry of the `Date` column from the `pets_with_date` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT Name, EXTRACT(DAY FROM Date) AS Day\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery.public-data.pet_records.pets_with_date`\n",
    "    \n",
    "SQL is very smart about dates, ans we can ask for information beyond just extracting part of the cell. For example, this query returns one column with just the week in the year (between 1 and 53) for each date in the `Date` column:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT Name, EXTRACT(WEEK FROM Date) AS Week\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery.public-data.pet_records.pets_with_date`\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Example: Which day of the week has the most fatal motor accidents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the US Traffic Fatality Records database, which contains information on traffic accidents in the US where at least one person died.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll investigate the `accident_2015` table. Here is a view of the first few rows. "
