    "# Groupby, Having & Count\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can select raw data, you're ready to learn how to group your data and count things within those groups. This can help you answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many of each kind of fruit has our store sold?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many species of animal has the vet office treated\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you'll learn about three new techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "**GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, and **COUNT()**. Once again, we'll use this made-up table of information on pets.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](pets.PNG \"pets\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## COUNT()\n",
    "\n",
    "**COUNT()**, as you may have guessed from the name, returns a count of things. If you pass it the name of a column, it will return the number of entries in that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we **SELECT** the **COUNT()** of the `ID` column in the `pets` table, it will return 4, because there are 4 ID's in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "query:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT COUNT(ID)\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**COUNT()** is an example of an **aggregate function**, which takes many values and returns one. Other eamples of aggregate functions include **SUM()**, **AVG()**, **MIN()**, and **MAX()**. Aggregate fnctions introduce strange column names (life `f0__`). Later in this tutorial, you'll learn how to change the name to something more descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GROUP BY\n",
    "\n",
    "**GROUP BY** takes the name of one or more columns, and treats all rows with the same value in that column as a single group when you apply aggregate functions like **COUNT()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we want to know how many of each type of animal we have in the `pets` table. We can use **GROUP BY** to group together rows that have the same value in the `Animal` column, while using **COUNT()** to find out how many ID's we have in each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "query:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT Animal, COUNT(ID)\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    GROUP BY Animal\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns a table with three rows (one for each distinct animal). We can see that the `pets` table contains 1 rabbit, 1 dog, and 2 cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## GROUP BY ... HAVING\n",
    "\n",
    "**HAVING** is used in combination with **GROUP BY** to ignore groups that don't meet certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this query, for example, will only include groups that have more than one ID in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "query:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT Animal, COUNT(ID)\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    GROUP BY Animal\n",
    "    HAVING COUNT(ID) > 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since only one group meets the specified criterion, the query will return a table with only one row.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Which Hacker News comments generated the most discussion?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hacker News dataset contains information on stories and comments from the Hacker News social networking site.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with the `comments` table and begin by printing the first few rows."
